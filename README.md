# Challenge-2-My-Profile

## Description

In this Project I was givenno starter code and had to build my own website from scratch. I learned so much about how elements work with one another and CSS. My design is definitely basic and can use a more modern look but I think I got all the key oints right which is what counts<index>  and to the CSS Stylesheet.

I looked at the elements and made them semantic, changed the title, inserted links in the header and matched those changes in CSS. My motivation was to look at the html and CSS stylesheet and discover how these work together. I learned how HTML and CSS work together.
