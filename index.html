          First I want to take out the time to thank you for visiting my website. It is a work in progress
          but I am happy with my progress so far. 
          I first became interested in Software development in 2016. There was a lot of talk about coding and 
          just what a person could do with the knowledge of it. I was pregnant at the time but did some research
          there were so many Careers to choose from when it came to technology but Coding always stood out.
          Due to life circustances I would not pursue coding for another 6 years.
          One night I was sitting at my job feeling tired and unsatisfied. My future looked bleak as a tech in the 
          Mental Health field and working nighshift is exhausting. I began to brainstorm and remembered about Coding.
          Several years ago I heard about a program held at University at Penn. I called the next day and today I am
          enrolled in the program.
          Understanding all that goes with becoming a Software Developer is tedious and time consuming but it is a skill
          that I believe will serve me well as a career and a foundation to understanding other Software programs and techniques.
